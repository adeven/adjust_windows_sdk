## Summary

This is the Windows SDK of AdjustIo. You can read more about it at [adjust.io][].

## Basic Installation

These are the minimal steps required to integrate the AdjustIo SDK into your Windows Store project. We are going to assume that you use Visual Studio 2012 with the NuGet package manager installed. The screenshots show the integration process for a Windows Store app, but the procedure is very similar for Windows Phone apps. The differences will get pointed out.

### 1. Install the package AdjustIo
In the Visual Studio menu select `TOOLS|Library Package Manager|Package Manager Console` to open the Package Manager Console view.

![][console]

After the `PM>` prompt, enter the following line and press `<Enter>` to install the [AdjustIo package][NuGet]:

    Install-Package AdjustIo

![][install]

### 2. Integrate AdjustIo into your app
In the Solution Explorer open the file `App.xaml.cs`. Add the `using` statement at the top of the file. In the `OnLaunched` method (`Application_Launching` for Windows Phone apps) of your app call the method `AppDidLaunch`. This tells AdjustIo about the launch of your Application.

    using adeven.AdjustIo;
    // ...
    AdjustIo.AppDidLaunch();

![][launch]

### 3. Build your app
From the menu select `DEBUG|Start Debugging`. After the app launched, you should see the debug log `Tracked session start` in the Output view.

You can improve the session tracking by calling `AppDidActivate` in `OnActivated` (`Application_Activated` for Windows Phone apps).

    protected override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args)
    {
        AdjustIo.AppDidActivate();
        // ...
    }

## Additional features

Once you integrated the AdjustIo SDK into your project, you can take advantage of the following features wherever you see fit.

### Add tracking of custom events
You can tell AdjustIo about every event you consider to be of your interest. Suppose you want to track every click on a button. Currently you would have to ask us for an eventId and we would give you one, like `abc123`. In your button's `Button_Click` method you could then add the following code to track the click:

    AdjustIo.TrackEvent("abc123");

You can also register a callback URL for that event and we will send a request to the URL whenever the event happens. In that cas you can also put some key-value-pairs in a dictionary and pass it to the trackEvent method. We will then forward these named parameters to your callback URL. Suppose you registered the URL `http://www.adeven.com/callback` for your event and execute the following lines:

    var parameters = new Dictionary<string, string> {
        { "key", "value" },
        { "foo", "bar" }
    };
    AdjustIo.TrackEvent("abc123", parameters);

In that case we would track the event and send a request to `http://www.adeven.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar`. In any case you need to import AdjustIo with `using adeven.AdjustIo` in any file that makes use of the SDK. Please note that we don't store your custom parameters. If you haven't registered a callback URL for an event, there is no point in sending us parameters.

### Add tracking of revenue
If your users can generate revenue by clicking on advertisements you can track those revenues. If the click is worth one Cent, you could make the following call to track that revenue:

    AdjustIo.TrackRevenue(1.0f);

The parameter is supposed to be in Cents and will get rounded to one decimal point. If you want to differentiate between different kinds of revenue you can get different eventIds for each kind. Again, you need to ask us for eventIds that you can then use. In that cas you would make a call like this:

    AdjustIo.TrackRevenue(1.0f, "abc123");

You can also register a callback URL again and provide a dictionary of named parameters, just like it worked with normal events.

    var parameters = new Dictionary<string, string> {
        { "key", "value" },
        { "foo", "bar" }
    };
    AdjustIo.TrackRevenue(1.0f, "abc123", parameters);

In any case, don't forget to import AdjustIo. Again, there is no point in sending parameters if you haven't registered a callback URL for that revenue event.
