## Migrate your adjust SDK for Windows to v4.0.2 from v3.5.1

### Initial setup

We changed how you configure the adjust SDK. All initial setup is now done with
a new config object. 
Here is an example of how the setup in `App.xaml.cs` might look before and
after the migration:

##### Before

```cs
Adjust.AppDidLaunch("{YourAppToken}");
Adjust.SetLogLevel(LogLevel.VERBOSE);
Adjust.SetLogDelegate(msg => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(msg));
Adjust.SetEnvironment(AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);
```

##### After

```cs
Adjust.SetupLogging(logDelegate: msg => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(msg),
   logLevel: LogLevel.Verbose);
string appToken = "{YourAppToken}";
string environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox;
var config = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);
Adjust.ApplicationLaunching(config);
```

### Event tracking

We also introduced proper event objects that can be set up before they are
tracked. Again, an example of how it might look like before and after:

##### Before

```cs
var parameters = new Dictionary<string, string> {
    { "key", "value" },
    { "foo", "bar" }
};
Adjust.TrackEvent("abc123", parameters);
```

##### After

```cs
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.addCallbackParameter("key", "value");
adjustEvent.addCallbackParameter("foo", "bar");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

### Revenue tracking

Revenues are now handled like normal events. You just set a revenue and a
currency to track revenues. Note that it is no longer possible to track revenues
without associated event tokens. You might need to create an additional event token
in your dashboard. The optional transaction ID is now a property of the event
instance.

*Please note* - the revenue format has been changed from a cent float to a whole 
currency-unit float. Current revenue tracking must be adjusted to whole currency
units (i.e., divided by 100) in order to remain consistent.

##### Before

```cs
Adjust.TrackRevenue(1.0, "abc123");
```

##### After

```cs
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent("abc123");
adjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, "EUR");
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);
```

## Additional steps if you come from 3.4.2

Add the following line to see log messages in the output. The messages will only be visible
when your app is built with the `Debug` configuration.

```cs
Adjust.SetLogDelegate(msg => System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(msg));
```

## Additional steps if you come from v2.1.0

We renamed the main class `AdjustIo` to `Adjust`. Follow these steps to update
all adjust SDK calls.

1. Open the nuget manager console. In the Visual Studio menu select 
   `TOOLS → Library Package Manager → Package Manager Console` to open the Package
   Manager Console view.

       ![][nuget_click]

2. Uninstall the Adjust package. After the `PM>` prompt, enter the following
   line and press `<Enter>` to uninstall the AdjustIo package:

    ```
    Uninstall-Package AdjustIo
    ```

    ![][nuget_migration_uninstall]

   It's also possible to uninstall the AdjustIo package through the NuGet package manager
   for your Windows Phone or Windows Store project.

3. Install the Adjust package. After uninstalling the AdjustIo package, keep in the
   same `PM>` prompt. Enter the following line and press `<Enter>` to install the
   new [Adjust package][NuGet]:

   ```
   Install-Package adjust
   ```

    ![][nuget_migration_install]

4. Replace the namespace import. In the Visual Studio menu select
   `EDIT → Find and Replace → Replace in Files` to open the Find and Replace window.
   Search for the import `using adeven.AdjustIo` and replace it for the import
   `using AdjustSdk`. Tick the checkbox `Keep Modified files open after Replace All` so
   it's easier to perform the next step. The file `App.xaml.cs` should be open, as
   well the ones used to track an event and/or revenue.

       ![][replace]

5. In the same files where the namespace was replaced, change the static invocations of
   the class `AdjustIo` to `Adjust`. For example, from `AdjustIo.TrackRevenue(1.5)` to
   `Adjust.TrackRevenue(1.5)`.


6. Replace the Environment enum references. In the `App.xaml.cs` file, where the method 
   `SetEnviornment` is called after the `AppDidLauch` method.

   Depending on whether or not you build your app for testing or for production,
   you must call the `SetEnvironment` method with one of these parameters:

   ```cs
   Adjust.SetEnvironment(AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox);
   Adjust.SetEnvironment(AdjustEnvironment.Production);
   ```

   **Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox` if
   and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the
   environment to `AdjustEnvironment.Production` just before you publish the
   app. Set it back to `AdjustEnvironment.Sandbox` when you start testing it
   again.

   We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and artificial
   traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value
   meaningful at all times! Especially if you are tracking revenue.

7. Replace the LogLevel enum references. In the `App.xaml.cs` file, 
   if you use the `SetLogLevel` method to change the default logging level, remove 
   the `AdjustIo` namespace prefix. For example, from `AdjustIo.LogLevel.Info`
   to `LogLevel.Info`.

8. Build your project to confirm that everything is properly connected again.

The adjust SDK v3.0.0 added delegate callbacks. Check out the [README] for
details.
